# Adventofcode 2017

Welcome to my repository about my solutions to Advent of Code 2017.
This is an Angular App, you can clone it to your pc and run with `ng serve`. 

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Further help

Feel free to contact me any time.
